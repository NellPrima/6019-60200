                <h3 class="one">Give Your Time</h3>
                <p class="paragraph1">
                    This is a hands-on role where you'll interact with the animals themselves. You could be walking dogs, socializing cats, cleaning kennels, or feeding the animals.  This is a great option for people who love animals and want to give them some TLC.

                <h3 class="one">Adoption Center Assistance</h3>

                <p class="paragraph1">
                    This role involves helping potential adopters find the perfect furry friend. You might greet visitors, answer questions about the animals, or even assist with the adoption process itself. This is a good fit for people who are outgoing and enjoy working with people.
                </p>

                <h3 class="one">Be a Foster Parent</h3>
                <div class="paragraph1">
                    Fostering involves providing a temporary loving home for an animal in need. This frees up space at the shelter and allows the animal to get used to a home environment. Fostering is a bigger commitment than some volunteer roles, but it's a wonderful way to make a real difference in an animal's life.  This is ideal for people who have the space and time to care for an animal but aren't ready for a lifelong pet commitment.
